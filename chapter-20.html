          This manifesto emerges as the targeting of immigrant communities and the violation of human rights continue: the likely ending of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), the refugee crisis across the globe, mass deportations, and pervasive institutional misconduct. Within this context, the word “sanctuary” has a multiplicity of meanings. For undocumented immigrants, it might mean a sanctuary city, where authorities claim to not report on the legal status of its residents, or the simple right of not being forcefully removed from one’s home for arbitrary reasons. For refugee families, who undergo years of applications, travel, interviews, and extensive vetting, it might mean finally arriving at a place where physical safety seems more possible than it was before. And for many others, it might mean a place where alienation, institutional abuse, and physical harm are not daily threats because of one’s cultural or religious practices—a place where, instead, the practices of individuals and communities are seen as rich and admirable contributions to society. Through an interrogation of the notion of “sanctuary,” this manifesto affirms the expertise of immigrants and immigrant-adjacent persons in imagining and building sanctuary.

        <p class="section-end-text">
          To cultivate the collaborative building of this manifesto, over the past year, Press Press has hosted a series of workshops in Baltimore, New York City, and Chicago. For each workshop, we invited local individuals who have a relationship to cultural passage, as well as members of our community in Baltimore, to gather over a dinner and have a discussion with the goal of answering three questions: What is sanctuary? How can sanctuary be created? How can sanctuary be protected? In order to answer these questions, we shared our own experiences around that term and attempted to unpack its various meanings. As our discussions unfolded, we added notes and ideas to our large manifesto board. These additions included only those things that the entire group agreed should be in the manifesto. However, there were certain cases where several opposing principles were included. This is because an essential element of sanctuary, according to the ideas this process has yielded, is its ability to morph and accommodate varying visions of its form and function, including sometimes contradictory ones. Later, we transformed our collection of notes from each workshop into the series of principles featured in the pages ahead. These principles incorporate the ideas we’ve gathered from every workshop.

        <p class="section-end-text">
          Rather than seeing this collection of items as a concrete and final destination, we understand the process we’ve undertaken this past year as a point of departure. We recognize that some of the principles outlined here are not easily realizable, nor are they pragmatic. However, because of the collaborative process we’ve undertaken, we recognize this manifesto’s power in representing a collective vision we can reference as we make practical efforts toward accomplishing our goals. As you go through the collection of items in the manifesto, we invite you to consider if and how sanctuary has manifested in your life and within your community. We invite you to be part of our process and contribute to answering our questions, or asking new ones that we have yet to think through.
