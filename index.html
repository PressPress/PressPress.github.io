      <i>Sentiments: Expressions of Cultural Passage</i> is a compilation of the sensitivities, hacks, gestures, and actions that we, as immigrants, have used to nourish and preserve ourselves, our families, and our communities. It serves as a toolkit for sanctuary-building, self-determination, and resistance, in the form of ongoing conversations, workshops, artist projects, and writings that explore cultural passage, immigrant identity, and notions of sanctuary. Through this compilation, Sentiments provides a first-person documentation of the various intersections of immigrant identities and the multiple and complicated facets of immigrant experiences. In complicating the traditional narratives, this collection of voices resists the reductive oversimplification of our racially diverse, multicultural, multilingual, and third-space identities, and offers a more nuanced treatment of the wide-ranging identities and experiences that characterize immigrant existence. Additionally, this series explores how the lived experiences of those who are called immigrants in the United States can inform our understanding of how white supremacy has constructed society—and how we can dismantle it.

I immigrated to the U.S. in 2003 in the middle of my career with my three children, my partner, and our dog. Currently, I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

I focus on women’s issues and themes related to human existence, its fragility and temporariness, and the possibilities of transformation. My personal experiences made me sensitive to and interested in issues of survival, identity, and healing and their complex relationship to violence, human experience, migration, rituals, nationalism, and culture.</p>
